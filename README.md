### Run this server
`django runserver`

# TODO

## 1. Fix the server
Something is happening with the server, the server is trying to run on port 8000, but when making request to / we aren't able to receive the health check.

## 2. Send the greetings from /greetings
Cool! you just fixed the server. Wait a second... ohhh no we aren't able to send response from /greetings route, fix the route to send the greetings.

## 3. Create more endpoints
Woow you are killing it, you already fix the server and we are sending greetings. Now we need to create more endpoints.
Using the API of [Rick and Morty](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest) we need to create the following endpoint.
- Get all the characters

---
### Extra points
- Get one character
- Search for a character
